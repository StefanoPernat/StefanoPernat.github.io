<p>My workplace is where I experience the most of my anxiety,
this sort of <strong>panic attacks</strong> happened in the following situations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My anxiety <strong>symptoms</strong> are the following</p>

<ul>
<li>I feel like I can&rsquo;t breathe</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m unable to swallow</li>
<li>I experience a lot of fear to die by choking</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
