<h2 id="hello-world">Hello World</h2>

<p>This is my first post from my <strong>new blog</strong>. It look pretty good even if
it&rsquo;s only an early stage.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-built-it">Why I built it</h2>

<p>I found it a very useful tool for talking about myself, my passions and my worries.</p>

<p>I have a strong anxiety issue, so I think this blog can help me to feel better and beat
this &ldquo;<strong>Monster</strong>&rdquo;.<br />
I would like to clarify that I haven&rsquo;t been diagnosed with any kind of panic disorder, I&rsquo;m
only trying to find a way to beat or limit my anxiety.</p>

<p>Maybe I need to look for a diagnose but I&rsquo;m scared about the outcome.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be scared, I will also post about my passions like <strong>reading</strong>,
<strong>software development</strong>, <strong>videogames</strong> and <strong>NBA</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-built-it">How I built it</h2>

<p>I make this blog using <strong>HUGO</strong>, a static website generator.</p>

<p><strong>HUGO</strong> is built using one of my favorite programmaing language:
<a href="https://golang.org/" title="Golang Homepage">Golang</a> an awesome programming language by
<em>Google</em>.</p>

<p>Before starting with <strong>Hugo</strong> I also considered <strong>Jekyll</strong> as my main platform
for developing this blog. I drop it because I don&rsquo;t know ruby enough for being
productive.</p>

<p>On the other hand I like Golang so much, and before dive into this project I stepped up
my knowledge of it by taking two online courses.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a couple of quotes from HUGO website, at first I thought only about marketing phrases
but after using it I can say this is true:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites</p>

<p>Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only <strong>cons</strong> I found in HUGO is the templating system, as it uses the Golang standard.<br />
I&rsquo;d prefer a more flexible one, but once experienced nothing is too difficult.</p>

<p>Sorry for my english, I&rsquo;m Italian, I&rsquo;d like to use this blog for learn it aswell.</p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t blame me for this, I&rsquo;m here to learn</p>

<p>Stefano</p>
